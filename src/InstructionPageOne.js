				<li>In this task, you are going to learn the ropes of being a fisherman. One part of the job is about catching fish and crabs whilst the other part is about <b>selling your catch for the best price.</b></li>
				<li>To protect the fish stock from overfishing, there are regulations in place that periodically restrict fishermen in what they are allowed to catch.</li>
				<li>So when they are not allowed to catch fish, the fishermen concentrate on catching crabs; and when regulations change again, fishermen adapt accordingly.</li>
				<li>Fishermen therefore have to <b>follow a 3 step procedure,</b> which you will learn in this task.</li>
